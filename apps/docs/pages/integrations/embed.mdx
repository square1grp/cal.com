# Embed

The Embed allows your website visitors to book a meeting with you directly from your website.

## Install on any website

TODO: Mention possibility of installation through tag managers as well

- _Step-1._ Install the Vanilla JS Snippet

  ```javascript
  (function (C, A, L) {
    let p = function (a, ar) {
      a.q.push(ar);
    };
    let d = C.document;
    C.Cal =
      C.Cal ||
      function () {
        let cal = C.Cal;
        let ar = arguments;
        if (!cal.loaded) {
          cal.ns = {};
          cal.q = cal.q || [];
          d.head.appendChild(d.createElement("script")).src = A;
          cal.loaded = true;
        }
        if (ar[0] === L) {
          const api = function () {
            p(api, arguments);
          };
          const namespace = ar[1];
          api.q = api.q || [];
          typeof namespace === "string" ? (cal.ns[namespace] = api) && p(api, ar) : p(cal, ar);
          return;
        }
        p(cal, ar);
      };
  })(window, "https://cal.com/embed.js", "init");
  ```

- _Step-2_. Initialize it

  ```javascript
  Cal("init)
  ```

## Install with a Framework

### embed-react

It provides a react component `<Cal>` that can be used to show the embed inline at that place.

```bash
yarn add @calcom/embed-react
```

### Any XYZ Framework

You can use Vanilla JS Snippet to install

  calLink: "jane", // The link that you want to embed. It would open https://cal.com/jane in embed
  config: {
    name: "John Doe", // Prefill Name
    email: "johndoe@gmail.com", // Prefill Email
    notes: "Test Meeting", // Prefill Notes
    guests: ["janedoe@gmail.com", "test@gmail.com"], // Prefill Guests
    theme: "dark", // "dark" or "light" theme
  },

## Supported Instructions

Consider an instruction as a function with that name and that would be called with the given arguments.

### `inline`

Appends embed inline as the child of the element.

```javascript
Cal("inline", { elementOrSelector, calLink });
````

- `elementOrSelector` - Give it either a valid CSS selector or an HTMLElement instance directly

- `calLink` - Cal Link that you want to embed e.g. john. Just give the username. No need to give the full URL [https://cal.com/john](). It makes it easy to configure the calendar host once and use as many links you want with just usernames

### `ui`

Configure UI for embed. Make it look part of your webpage.

```javascript
Cal("inline", { styles });
```

- `styles` - It supports styling for `body` and `eventTypeListItem`. Right now we support just background on these two.

### preload

Usage:

If you want to open cal link on some action. Make it pop open instantly by preloading it.

```javascript
Cal("preload", { calLink });
```

- `calLink` - Cal Link that you want to embed e.g. john. Just give the username. No need to give the full URL [https://cal.com/john]()
